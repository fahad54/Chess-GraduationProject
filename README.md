Chess Game
=====

I helped in performing architectural decisions to meet all the technical and operational requirements. Performed analysis and design of the problems presented and suggested solutions to build the software.

I implemented the following parts when I was taking a break from the tech industry.

* GUI
* Chess board 
* Chess pieces 
* Legal move generator (Inspired by the work done at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emjDFIwzXZQ)
* Chess game AI (Inspired by the work done at http://kenai.com/projects/chessgame)
* Tree-like representation of the game
* Algorithms for managing this tree (minimax search & alpha-beta pruning)

Did not bothered to change the default text while creating new files. This 'To change this template, choose Tools Templates and open the template in the editor' annoying text will appear in almost every file and has been reported here: https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=208801
